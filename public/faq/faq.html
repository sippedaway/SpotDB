                <h2>What is SpotDB?</h2>
                <p>SpotDB is a platform that lets you search for all (or most) entries on Spotify, including but not limited to albums, profiles, artists, playlists, tracks, and more!<br>SpotDB is completely open-source, and uses the official Spotify WebAPI.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="answer2" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>How to use SpotDB - A guide</h2>
                <p>SpotDB is a platform for fetching public information from Spotify. Let us guide you through the process and leave additional tips!</p>
                
                <p><br><br>- Searching & finding anything
                <br>In the <a href="/">home</a> page or via the navigation bar search bar you can <b>search up a keyword</b> and find all results: albums, playlists, shows, artists, tracks, etc.
                <br>The <b>Top results</b> will help you find the most relevant items, while scrolling and looking through more items will show all items.
                <br>For a more advanced search, use the <b>Filters</b> on the left to change the Region (market) and/or the amount of results (default: 12)
                <br><br>Once you find what you were looking for, <b>click on the item!</b></p>

                <p><br><br>- Item pages (/r/[ID])
                <br>Once you open an item, you will see all information about it, including <b>a table with most relevant information</b>, tabs with information like <b>artists, tracklist, images, etc</b> depending on the item type (album, artist, track, etc)
                </p>

                <p><br><br>- Users (/users & /r/[username])
                <br>To search for users, go to the <a href="/users">Users</a> page, and search for a username. Note that you can only search for exact usernames and/or the exact user ID, not display names.
                <br>Once you find the user you were looking for, click on it to open their profile page, where you can see their public playlists, and other information, if it exists.</p>

                <p><br><br>- Other tips
                <br><b>IDs are important - </b>they will always lead to the correct item; to the correct page; to the correct Spotify URL; etc.
                <br><b>Explicit tags - </b>if a track is explicit, it will show an "E" tag next to the track name.
                <br><b>Embeds - </b>you can embed albums, tracks, playlists, artists, episodes and shows using the "Embed" tab on each item page.
                <br><b>Copy Spotify URL - </b>you can copy the Spotify URL of any item using the "Copy Spotify URL" button on each item page.
                <br><b>Open in Spotify - </b>you can open any item in Spotify using the "Open in Spotify" button on each item page. Works on mobile *and* PC!

                <p><br>Even though we use the official Spotify API, there still are limitations. Find out more <a href="#9">here.</a></p>

                <h2>Where do we find this data?</h2>
                <p>SpotDB uses the official Spotify WebAPI to complete certain tasks, such as search, fetch data, gather all information and more.</p>

            <div id="answer4" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>Can I contribute to SpotDB?</h2>
                <p>Yes, SpotDB is open-source. You can contribute by visiting the <a href="https://github.com/sippedaway/SpotDB">GitHub repository</a>, creating Issues and more. Extremely grateful for all help :)</p>
            </div>
            <div id="answer5" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>Where can I get the source code?</h2>
                <p>The source code is available in our <a href="https://github.com/sippedaway/SpotDB">GitHub repository!</a></p>
            </div>
            <div id="answer6" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>What language is SpotDB written in?</h2>
                <p>SpotDB is a vanilla HTML/CSS/Javascript website together with Node.js + Express backend. yes it's very bad lol</p>
            </div>
            <div id="answer7" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>Does SpotDB have an API? Is SpotDB an API?</h2>
                <p>No, we directly fetch Spotify data and if you need that data, you should fetch from there too. The Spotify WebAPI is completely free and easy to get started with, and you will find it <a href="developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api">here</a>.<br><br>We are an open-source and free-to-use website made by a single random person for fun! Respectfully, I can't just create APIs out of nowhere and maintain them.<br></p>
            </div>
            <div id="answer8" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>Why are there no charts, streams, etc.?</h2>
                <p>SpotDB directly fetches data straight from Spotify and currently, the Spotify WebAPI does not provide such data.<br>In the long term, we may start using third-party and/or external APIs to get such data, if needed, although that likely will not happen for several reasons, the main one being that it goes against the main premise of SpotDB showing official Spotify data.<br>Currently, we gather all data that Spotify officially provides to their public API, so no, don't expect everything to be included, including the charts, streams, or the song itself.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="answer9" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>What can I search?</h2>
                <p>You can pretty much search for everything on Spotify, with one exception.<br><br><b>Albums, tracks (+ EPs), artists, playlists, episodes and shows.</b> To see how to find <b>Spotify users</b> on SpotDB, click <a href="#users">here.</a></p>
            </div>
            <div id="answer10" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>ID</h2>
                <p>Each item in Spotify has a unique ID, that looks something like <a href="/r/4PTG3Z6ehGkBFwjybzWkR8">"4PTG3Z6ehGkBFwjybzWkR8"</a> (a real ID). There cannot be two items with the same ID.<br><br><b>Note:</b> some IDs could be broken or lead to either wrong or confusing pages, like the username *and* ID "undefined"</p>
            </div>
            <div id="answer11" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>Copyrights</h2>
                <p>Copyrights are labels defined by the item's record label, artist or publisher, and represent who owns this item, legally speaking. There's more to this information, such as artists owning the songwriting rights, and more.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="answer12" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>Region (Market)</h2>
                <p>Most items include "available_markets", which defines where this item can be found. There are multiple releases that are region-locked and can only be found there. This is defined by the item's record label, artist or publisher.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="answer13" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>External IDs</h2>
                <p>Most items include "external_ids", which are IDs completely unrelated to the <a href="#id">Spotify unique item ID</a>. Examples of these external_ids can be the UPC or ISBN IDs.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="answer14" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>Embed</h2>
                <p>You can embed Spotify albums, tracks, playlists, artists, episodes and shows, using an <b>iframe embed</b>. On all items <b>excluding users</b> you can easily generate these embeds, preview them, and copy the code from the "Embed" tab. You can customize the width and height and use them in your websites, HTML projects, and more.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="answer15" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>You leaked this!</h2>
                <p>Oh well. Once again, we fetch details from the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api">Spotify WebAPI</a>, and if something has been leaked, we are not the ones involved.<br>We control NOTHING, and it is purely the fault of the Spotify WebAPI and/or more likely the labels/artists/publishers releasing the wrong data or just too soon. We are a platform to fetch PUBLIC data.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="answer16" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>Do I have to sign in to use SpotDB?</h2>
                <p><b>Nope!</b><br>The way SpotDB works is when you open SpotDB, a Spotify API access token is generated, which is a temporary anonymous token only for you! Note that we do not see any token(s) and/or data, nor does that data include anything sensitive.<br>Anyway, with said access token, you can search, fetch data, and more without having to ever sign-in, sign-up, connect your Spotify account, or anything else!.<br><br>In the future, an optional Spotify sign-in feature could be created for some additional features, like viewing your profile, but that's for later!</p>
            </div>
            <div id="answer17" class="faq-answer">
                <h2>Legal</h2>
                <p>SpotDB is <b>unaffiliated with Spotify</b> and/or any labels, artists, record companies, etc. If there's something wrong, please <a href="#19">contact me.</a></p>

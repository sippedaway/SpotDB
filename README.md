An open-source platform to explore and find detailed information about Spotify tracks, albums, artists, and more...

[<kbd> <br> db.sipped.org <br> </kbd>](https://db.sipped.org)

## What is SpotDB?
SpotDB is a website that lets you search for Spotify albums, tracks, artists & more, and get detailed information about what you searched for. SpotDB is open-source and uses Spotify's WebAPI.

## Spotify API usage
SpotDB uses the [Spotify WebAPI](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to fetch quick and correct information straight from Spotify. We do not require you to sign-in with Spotify.

## Status
When servers are unactive, the website isn't working, you found bugs, or have questions - **email me at** hello@sipped.org
Responses usually take <30 minutes unless I'm sleeping. Check my GitHub timezone :)

**Currently the website is in development and not even hosted on the domain**

## Version
#### 1.0
- **Estimated release date:** Mid-way February 2025
- Base release

## Legal
SpotDB is a passion/hobby project made by [me, sipped,](https://github.com/sippedaway) and is **NOT affiliated with Spotify** in any way whatsoever.
Dear Spotify, if you want us to change the name of SpotDB, please contact me @ hello@sipped.org :)

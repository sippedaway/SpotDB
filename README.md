# [SpotDB](https://db.sipped.org/)
SpotDB is a platform that lets you search for Spotify albums, tracks, artists, playlists ([and more](#As-much-information-as-you-probably-need), and gather detailed information about what you searched for. SpotDB is a completely open-source platform that uses the official Spotify [WebAPI](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), as well as additional [third-party APIs](#API) to gather information like track lyrics, writers and more.

## Search and get what you want
The Search that is quickly available through the Home page gathers <b>tracks, albums, singles, EPs, artists, playlists, episodes and shows</b> (with the exception of users) using the Spotify [Search](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/search) WebAPI. Use filters to get exactly what you want.

## API
SpotDB uses **the official Spotify WebAPI** to gather all public information for any Spotify entry item!

However, Spotify's API is still kinda limited. For instance, **user profiles can't be searched**. SpotDB supports fetching user's **public** profile/data anyway, and we plan to do so, however the search bars will not find you user profiles. To get a user's profile, you'll need to go to db.sipped.org/**r/{a user ID}**. The User ID can be found by going on Spotify, finding the profile and copying the ID from the URL or by clicking Share. The unavailability might soon change, as we're working on a permanent solution.

## As much information as you probably need
The information you find depends on what you look for, but overall it is **EVERYTHING Spotify stores** in their public API!
